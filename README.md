# Neural Networks for recognition of hand-written digits

Neural Networks implementation for hand-written digit recognition. First implemented in MATLAB as a part of the Machine Learning course by Prof. Andrew Ng on Coursera (authorised by Stanford University). Here, I intend to repeat this exercise using Python instead.

I shall proceed as follows:
1. Implement the backpropagation algorithm for learning the neural network parameters.
2. Implement the feedforward propagation algorithm to use learned parameters for prediction.
